2) What is working?

Both Gossip Algorithm and Push-Sum Algorithm are working for all the topologies.


3) What is the largest network you managed to deal with for each type of topology and algorithm?

The below table lists the largest network we have dealed with for each type of topology and algorithm:

Algorithm	|	Full	|	2D	|	Imp2D	|	Line
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gossip		|	100000	|	100000	|	100000	|	20000
Push-Sum	|	20000	|	20000	|	20000	|	20000


4) Instructions for building and running the program in Linux environment:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Set up the required folder structure:
-------------------------------------
a) In the Linux environment, create a folder called Project2.
b) Download Akka 2.3.6 distribution for Scala 2.11. Unzip it and copy the contents from "akka_2.11-2.3.6\lib" folder to Project2 folder.
c) Download scala-2.11.2 and extract it into Project2 folder.
d) Place project2.scala file in Project2 folder.
e) Place application.conf file in "Project2\scala-2.11.2\bin" folder. 
 
To build project2.scala:
------------------------
a) Open command prompt.
b) Navigate to "Project2\scala-2.11.2\bin" path and issue the following command:
./scalac -cp "../../akka/*:../../scala-library-2.11.2.jar:." ../../project2.scala

To run project2.scala:
--------------------------------
a) Open command prompt.
b) Navigate to "Project2\scala-2.11.2\bin" path and issue the following command. 
./scala -cp "../../akka/*:../../scala-library-2.11.2.jar:." project2 numNodes topology algorithm

Where numNodes is the number of actors involved, topology is one of full, 2D, line, imp2D, algorithm is one of gossip, push-sum.
